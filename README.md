# Logistic Regression with Python

We will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.

The following metrixcs are obtained:

             precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.72      0.65      0.68        20
           1       0.84      0.88      0.86        41

    accuracy                           0.80        61
    macro avg       0.78      0.76      0.77        61
    weighted avg       0.80      0.80      0.80        61
